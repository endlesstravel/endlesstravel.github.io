# Create C# App with Love2DCS

---

> We assume you are using Visual Studio.

We only need 3 steps to set up a Love2DCS app:

1. Create a console application.
1. Install a NuGet package.
1. Set the target platform.

## 1. Create Console App

In your Visual Studio, create a new project, `Console App (.NET Framework)` or `Console App (.NET Core)`, and choose the latest framework version.

You can also do this via command line: `dotnet new console`

## 2. Install NuGet Package

We need to install the [Love2DCS package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Love2DCS/) using NuGet. NuGet has both a GUI and a command-line interface to work with packages in your projects.

> If you don't have NuGet in your Visual Studio, you can reference [Using NuGet in Visual Studio 2010 & 2012](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-core-dotnet/wiki/Using-Nuget-in-Visual-Studio-2010-&-2012) and [Using NuGet in Visual Studio 2005 & 2008](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-core-dotnet/wiki/Using-Nuget-in-Visual-Studio-2005-&-2008).

### Using GUI

In the `Solution Explorer` window, right-click the project node and you will see a new context menu, `Manage NuGet Packages`.

Clicking this menu will bring up the `Manage NuGet Packages` dialog. The package source is a publicly hosted server on the Internet that hosts both open-source and closed-source libraries and components.

Click `Browse` and type `Love2DCS` in the search box. You should see something like this:

Click `Install` to install the Love2DCS library into the project.

### Using Command Line

After installing NuGet (if you didn't already have it), or if you are using Visual Studio 2015, to open the `Package Manager Console`, click the `Tools Menu` and choose `NuGet Package Manager` and then choose `Package Manager Console`.

Type `Install-Package Love2DCS`. After a few seconds, the library should be installed.

Or simply: `dotnet add package Love2DCS`

## 3. Set Target Platform

To configure the project to target a 64-bit platform:

1. On the menu bar, choose `Build` > `Configuration Manager`.
1. In the `Active solution platform` list, choose a 64-bit platform for the solution to target, and then click the `Close` button.
    1. If the platform that you want doesn't appear in the `Active solution platform` list, choose `New`. The New Solution Platform dialog box appears.
    1. In the `Type or select the new platform` list, choose `x64`. (If you give your configuration a new name, you may have to modify the settings in the Project Designer to target the correct platform.)
    1. If you want to copy the settings from the current platform configuration, choose that, and then click the `OK` button.

  [How to: Configure projects to target platforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-configure-projects-to-target-platforms?view=vs-2017)

You can also do this manually by adding `<Platform>x64</Platform>` to your `.csproj` file:

```XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework>
    <Platform>x64</Platform>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Love2DCS" Version="11.0.30" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

And we're ready to make our first game!

## 4. (Optional) Launch the Love2dCS library without the console

In fact, Love2dCS uses the console to output some debug.

Right click your project in the solution explorer and select properties. Then, under the "Application" tab change the "Output type" of your project from "Console Application" to "Windows Application."

And debug messages will print into the visual studio debugging window.
