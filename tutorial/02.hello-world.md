# Hello World!

> We assume that you have basic knowledge of C#, and you have Visual Studio installed.

Let's be super-original and create a Hello World app as our first game!

## Simple Example

First, let's look at the very minimal app that draws "Hello, World" on screen.

```C#
using Love;
public class Program : Scene
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Boot.Init();
        Boot.Run(new Program());
    }

    public override void Draw()
    {
        Graphics.Print("Hello, World!", 400, 300);
    }
}
```

Here, we simply initialize Love2DCS by passing it an instance of the `Program` class, derived from the `Scene` class. Then we override the `Draw` method to draw the text with a one-liner. Super simple!

## Core Callbacks

In Love2DCS, the most important parts of the API are these callbacks:

* `Love.Scene.Load`: Here you do a one-time setup of your game (loading assets, configuring things).
* `Love.Scene.Update`: Manage your game's state frame to frame.
* `Love.Scene.Draw`: Render the game state onto the screen.

In essence, all you need is to inherit the class `Scene` and override its methods `Load`, `Update`, and `Draw`. This allows you to handle almost all aspects of a fully-featured game.

There are many more useful methods to override, but these three are the backbone of any app.

## Animated Example

Let's see a little more involved example. After all, we're making games, so we want stuff to move around and be interesting. Static text won't do!

```C#
using Love;

namespace Game
{
	public class Program : Scene
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			// Initialize the Love2DCS framework.
			Boot.Init();
			Boot.Run(new Program());
		}

		// ----------------------------------------------------------------

		private float textX, textY;
		private string text = "Hello, World!";

		private float timer;
		private float offsetY;

		// This is the ideal place to load assets (images, audio, text), set up defaults, and initialize stuff.
		// This is only ever called once.
		public override void Load()
		{
			// Love2DCS comes with a preloaded default font, if you don't set it yourself.
			var defaultFont = Graphics.GetFont();

			// Calculate the dimensions of the "Hello, World!" string...
			var textWidth = defaultFont.GetWidth(text);
			var textHeight = defaultFont.GetHeight();

			// ...so we can put it exactly at the center of the screen.
			textX = Graphics.GetWidth() / 2 - textWidth / 2;
			textY = Graphics.GetHeight() / 2 - textHeight / 2;
		}

		// This is where you typically update the game's state, move actors around, deal damage, etc.
		// The "dt" parameter here is the time elapsed since the last frame (in seconds). Useful for framerate-independent simulation.
		public override void Update(float dt)
		{
			// Pressing the Escape key will quit the game.
			if (Keyboard.IsPressed(KeyConstant.Escape))
			{
				Event.Quit();
			}

			// Let's increase our timer, but faster than real time...
			timer += dt * 3.0f;

			// ...and "oscillate" the offset 25 pixels up and down.
			offsetY = Mathf.Sin(timer) * 25.0f;
		}

		// This is where you draw all your graphics to the screen.
		public override void Draw()
		{
			// Yellow is nice!
			Graphics.SetColor(Color.Yellow);

			// Draw the text at the center, but use the offset to make it oscillate.
			Graphics.Print(text, textX, textY + offsetY);
		}
	}
}
```

When you run the app, you should see a yellow text going up and down around the center of the screen.


<!---
This section explains how to start a new Love2DCS project. When beginning to write games using Love2DCS, the most important parts of the API are these callbacks:

* `Love.Scene.Load`: Here you do a one-time setup of your game (loading assets, configuring things).
* `Love.Scene.Update`: Manage your game's state frame to frame.
* `Love.Scene.Draw`: Render the game state onto the screen.

In essence, all you need is to inherit the class `Scene` and override its methods `void Load()`, `void Update(float dt)`, and `void Draw()`. This allows you to handle almost all aspects of a fully-featured game.

There are many more useful methods to override, but these three are the backbone.

#### 1. Create a C# console application.

#### 2. Put the following code in the file (maybe Program.cs) and save it.

?> Don't worry about the meaning of this code. We'll elaborate on what it all means later.

``` C#
using Love;
namespace Example
{
    class Program : Love.Scene
    {
        float x, y, w, h;
        public override void Load()
        {
            x = 20;
            y = 20;
            w = 60;
            h = 20;
        }

        public override void Update(float dt)
        {
            w = w + 1;
            h = h + 1;
        }

        public override void Draw()
        {
            Graphics.SetColor(0, 0.3f, 0.3f);
            Graphics.Rectangle(DrawMode.Fill, x, y, w, h);
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Boot.Init();
            Boot.Run(new Program());
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Run the application: `Debug/Start Debugging` or press `F5`.
