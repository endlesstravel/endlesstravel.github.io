# Hello World

> Here I assume that you have the basic knowledge of C#, and you have installed Visual Studio.

This section will tell you how to start a Love2dCS project. When beginning to write games using LÃ–VE, the most important parts of the API are the callbacks : 

* `Love.Scene.Load` : to do one-time setup of your game.
* `Love.Scene.Update` : which is used to manage your game's state frame-to-frame.
* `Love.Scene.Draw` : which is used to render the game state onto the screen.

By inheriting the class `Scene` and override the method `void Load()` `void Update(dt)` `void Draw()` , you can handle input from the user, and other aspects of a full-featured game.

#### 1. Create a C# console application.

#### 2. Put the following code in the file(maybe Program.cs), and save it.

``` C#
using Love;
namespace Example
{
    class Program : Love.Scene
    {
        float x, y, w, h;
        public override void Load()
        {
            x = 20;
            y = 20;
            w = 60;
            h = 20;
        }

        public override void Update(float dt)
        {
            w = w + 1;
            h = h + 1;
        }

        public override void Draw()
        {
            Graphics.SetColor(0, 0.3f, 0.3f);
            Graphics.Rectangle(DrawMode.Fill, x, y, w, h);
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Boot.Run(new Program());
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Run application : `Debug/Start Debugging` or press `F5`
